## Why did I build this App?

In 2011 I started running in preparation for the military. I was quickly captivated by all aspects of running. In the last eight years, I have run over 80 different races, including two half-marathons and a 50-mile ultra-marathon in Guam. My goal is run more ultra-marathons (anything over marathon distance) and it think it would be great if I coult track my progress with an application build by me.

## What does this app do?
This application allows the user to view, join, and create group running goals, as well as track their runs. The user has the ability to view the time, distance, and average pace for each run either in a table, as a bar chart or a cool bubble chart. I plan difference way to visualize the data because data visualization is awesome.

## Challenges
Building the backend was challenging but very satisfying once it was complete. I also feel like learning D3 is a continual challenge and I am excited to continue to work with it.

## Fun
I used React Context to maintain the app's global state. The majority of the React is done using the Hooks API, because of its flexibility, give me the ability to use state in functional components, and it is fairly new and I want to learn as much as I can.
